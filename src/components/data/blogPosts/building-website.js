<h1>Building My Personal Website: A Journey in Code and Design</h1>

<p>Creating this personal website has been one of the most rewarding projects I've undertaken recently. It's more than just a portfolio or blog – it's a digital representation of who I am and what I care about.</p>

<h2>The Technology Stack</h2>

<p>After considering various options, I settled on a modern, efficient stack:</p>

<h3>React</h3>
<p>I chose React for its component-based architecture and vibrant ecosystem. The ability to create reusable components meant I could build a consistent design system while keeping my code organized and maintainable.</p>

<h3>Tailwind CSS</h3>
<p>Tailwind's utility-first approach was perfect for this project. It allowed me to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rapidly prototype and iterate on designs</li>
  <li>Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography</li>
  <li>Create responsive layouts with ease</li>
  <li>Keep my CSS bundle size optimized</li>
</ul>

<h3>React Router</h3>
<p>For seamless navigation between pages without full page reloads, React Router was the obvious choice. It enables the smooth, app-like experience I wanted for visitors.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>I wanted this site to feel personal, warm, and approachable. Here are the key design decisions I made:</p>

<h3>Color Palette</h3>
<p>I chose a light blue color scheme to create a calm, friendly atmosphere. Blue represents trust, stability, and creativity – values that are important to me both personally and professionally.</p>

<h3>Typography and Spacing</h3>
<p>Clean, readable fonts and generous white space help visitors focus on the content without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<h3>Animations and Interactions</h3>
<p>Subtle scroll-triggered animations and hover effects add personality without being distracting. The goal was to create delightful micro-interactions that enhance the user experience.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<h3>Interactive Timeline Resume</h3>
<p>Instead of a traditional static resume, I created an animated timeline that reveals information as you scroll. Each section appears with a smooth fade-in animation, making the browsing experience more engaging.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Blog System</h3>
<p>The blog is built to be easily extensible. Each post is structured with metadata including tags, read time estimation, and publication dates. The system automatically generates excerpts and handles routing to individual posts.</p>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<p>Every component was built mobile-first, ensuring the site looks and works great on all devices.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Building this site reinforced several important principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User Experience First</strong>: Every technical decision should serve the user experience</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Matters</strong>: Fast loading times and smooth interactions are non-negotiable</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility is Essential</strong>: Beautiful design means nothing if it's not accessible to everyone</li>
  <li><strong>Iterate and Improve</strong>: The best projects evolve over time based on real usage and feedback</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This project reminded me why I love web development. The combination of technical problem-solving, creative design, and the satisfaction of building something that represents who you are is incredibly fulfilling.</p>
